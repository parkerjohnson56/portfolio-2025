            background="This project was created during my internship at Global Tech to showcase my proficiency in JavaScript. The goal was to develop an interactive web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating my front-end development skills and problem-solving abilities."
            problem="The project aimed to highlight my ability to build dynamic and interactive web applications. The challenge was to create a functional game that engaged users while implementing JavaScript logic for interactivity and user experience."
            process="I started by reviewing the source code to understand its structure and how everything was connected. Once I had a clear understanding, I wrote the JavaScript file from scratch, implementing the game logic to handle card flipping, checking for matches, and keeping track of the game state. After the core functionality was working, I customized the design using CSS to give the game a unique look. Finally, I tested the game to ensure all the logic worked correctly and that there were no bugs."
            results="By the end of the project, I had built a fully functional card-matching game that successfully showcased my JavaScript skills. The game logic worked smoothly, and the customized CSS gave it a more polished look. This project helped me improve my ability to write JavaScript from scratch, work with pre-existing code, and troubleshoot issues through testing."
