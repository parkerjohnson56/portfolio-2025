            background="When applying for an internship at Domain Driven Solutions, I built a two-page mock website called Velci-Pet, a fictional veterinary company. The goal was to showcase my ability to develop modern, interactive web applications using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. This project focused on user experience and dynamic functionality, highlighting my skills in building responsive interfaces and handling form interactions."
            problem="There was no existing website, so I had to design and develop everything from the ground up. The main challenge was creating a clean, professional site that included an appointment sign-up form with validation while ensuring an intuitive user experience. The objective was to demonstrate my proficiency in React components, state management, and form handling within a Next.js framework."
            process="I began by structuring the website with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance. Using Tailwind CSS, I styled the components for a sleek, mobile-friendly design. I then implemented React state management to handle dynamic interactions, such as updating form fields in real time. For the appointment sign-up form, I incorporated client-side validation to ensure users entered correct information before submission. I also leveraged Next.js routing to create a seamless navigation experience between the homepage and the appointment form page. After development, I conducted testing and refinements to improve responsiveness and usability."
            results="By the end of the project, I had developed a fully functional, modern two-page website that effectively showcased my ability to build with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. The site featured a responsive layout, an intuitive sign-up form with validation, and smooth page transitions. This project reinforced my experience in React development, form validation, and UI design, preparing me for real-world front-end development challenges."
